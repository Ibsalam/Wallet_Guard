# The Story

My interest in financial management began when I started working in my own shop and had to manage my own budget for the first time. I quickly realized how challenging it can be to keep track of all expenses and savings. During this time, I experimented with various budgeting apps, but none of them met all my needs. This sparked my passion for creating a tool that would simplify financial management for me and others. The journey of building WalletGuard has been driven by my desire to help people avoid the stress and confusion I experienced.

That is why we created WalletGuard!

A Kanban board on Trello was utilized throughout in order to keep tasks and communication organized. The HTML/CSS front end and the way routing was designed, allowed WalletGuard to have more dynamic features without handcuffing the rest of the project. A REST API allowed for this frontend to interact with out backend in a simple and well documented way. We decided to use ORM and MySQL because of modularity and familiarity.

Front End

* HTML for web components handling 
* Css for consistent styling
* API calls to manipulate database
